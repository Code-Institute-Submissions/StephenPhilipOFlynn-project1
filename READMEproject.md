15.30 - My website is for a fictional chess-themed coffee shop.
The coffee shop will have an address in Dublin city on Drury street, and primarily be a place to relax, with weekly social chess meet ups.
15.44 – The shop will also be a place for people to stop in and drink coffee

Credits – 
22.10 – visual queue added  when hovering over home, gallery, signup
22.32 – hero image replaced two coffee cups image with chessboard. It looks far too small, check resolution when size increased. Looks okay on laptop screen, but too small on monitor.
22.31 – added transform property on hero image. Consider stronger main image.
13.03.2023

00.51 – skeleton of gallery page added.
00.59 – fix social media view icons issue tomorrow.

18/03/2023

14.33 – 4th blurb about the benefits of chess. 
14.44 – Add underline styling and symbols to headings, check fonts.

22/03/
22.10 – added contact phone number and address to index and gallery page.
00.15 – come back to add opening times, and consider push why visit us, event away from left edge. Sections overlapping on register page. May resolve when add registration form but would be nice to fix before that. Next big thing to resolve is appearance on mobile site. Also size of hero image far too big. Need to look at making hero image smaller but keeping aspect ratio.
26/03/2023
11.50 – need to make a call as to whether to add background images to events pages. 
12.40 – mobile device – two images working. On mobile site, need to remove padding on header. So it doesn’t overlap right edge of small displays.

13.03 – hero image not displaying at all three levels on updated site.
13.04 – Correct formatting on Why Visit Us and Events so that consistent on mobile and pad devices.

00.20 - The second image not clearing the events details. Amended at computer level. At mobile level, why visit us / and events, still different sizes. Resolve this tomorrow. Tomorrow, style css on registration section. Also need to fix the way web-page sections appear on mobile site.
29/03/2023
23.09 – trying to style button on register page.
23.23 – styling for button displaying on mobile but not computer. Not sure if cache not updating or responsive design issue.
23.29 – not sure I can include a functioning subscribe button without backend. Or perhaps send to my own email. Reset button working.
23.34 – at ipad level, heading and menu pages not aligned.
23.38 – not sure why reg form and subscribe button different sizes. Looks slightly jarring ugly. CSS not pulling through on browser. Not sure if cache issue. 
23.47 – buttons now the same size. Fonts lack consistency.
00.21 – amending formatting on registration page at mobile / ipad level. Not sure if CSS pulling through on non-mobile devices. Try restarting computer to see changes, or using Brave browser as appears to have quicker cache refresh.
1.06 – image doesn’t look very good on signup page, add as background or remove tomorrow.
31/03/2023 
22.15 – two bugs on jigsaw code validator. “#cover-text – missing

13.30 - Consider margin left for events, as inconsistent with why visit us.
14.12 – Add pictures to Register page to make more appealing.
14.31 – questions for mentor. What about creating a form dump, however the  project is supposed to be purely html and css, so I think to have elements showing responsive button should be sufficient to demonstrate the input form for newsletter.

07/04/2023
21.09 – following mentor meeting. Using display: flex; and row-reverse to have formatting looking correct at iphone level. Told me to include, blank head tags for code validation on section bugs.
21.17 – using tinypng.com to compress images, to make them load quicker.
8/04/2023 – 11.50. some formatting issues fixed on register and contact us sections. Still need to try and get consistency between why visit us and events heading at iphone level.
